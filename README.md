# chatbot
This project is a speech-to-speech chatbot built from scratch, designed to convert spoken input into a conversational response and output the response as speech. The chatbot integrates natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition technologies, providing an interactive and seamless voice-based conversational experience.
